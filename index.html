        <h2>What is Version Control</h2>
        <p class="p">Version Control, also known as Revision Control or Source Code Management, is the management of changes to documents, computer programs, websites or other collection of information.
        These changes are often identified as numbers or letter code, termed as revision number. Each revision is associated with meta data like timestamp, author(a person who made changes), etc. Revisions can be compared, restored or merged.</p>
        <h2>Why Git</h2>
        <p class="p">As a version control system, Git is delivered within Unix style command line methods, and these commands ultimately create the backbone of Git’s software. MacOS & Linux Operating Systems have a built-in terminal shell that supports Unix-based command line features whereas Microsoft Windows Operating System command line prompt is not a Unix-based terminal.</p>
        <h2>Introduction to Git Bash</h2>
        <p class="p">Git Bash is an application for Microsoft Windows OS environments which provides Unix based shell utilities & experience for Git command line commands.</p>
        <h2>Using Gitbash</h2>
        <li class="li"> First of all, you need to link git bash with repository on git hub. For that we have to to use following commands</li><br>

        <li class="li">Then we will either create an empty repository or we will clone some other repository present on github. We will create new one using init command. Furthermore, I created index.html file and i will try to add it on github</li><br>

        <li class="li">After adding file to local repository, we have to link it with online repository and commit it to keep track record.</li><br>

        <li class="li">After Linking file to repository, we have to do one last thing. PUSH!</li><br>
        <center><img src="images/push.png" alt=""></center>
        <p class="p">Thats it, we have succesfully used git bash and file is now listed on git hub</p><br>
